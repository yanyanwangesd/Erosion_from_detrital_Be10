# Erosion_from_detrital_Be10
## 1) The algorithm
This repository includes functions and scripts needed for erosion rate calculation from detrital Be10 concentrations. The core algorithm is from [Lupker et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.020). Please cite the paper if you use the codes here. The core algorithm is presented in the Lupker et al 2012 paper:
